# ClickyGame
React Assignment

The purpose of this game is to see how long you can go without clicking on the same image after the images are shuffled.

*Progress Notes*

1) At this time, the shuffle function does not operate "onClick" so this will need to be re-worked.

2) There is a filter that needs to be added to diffenerentiate between image IDs that are already clicked and those that are not.

3) A functional scoreboard needs to also be added.

4) Image rendering is to be improved. It seems as though importing bootstrap's media grid distorts the layout of the images in grid format but I am not certain of this. CSS styling seems to be overriden. However the gridding works as expected.
